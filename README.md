# CSS-AdvancedEffects-Classwork 

## Goal: 
Creating complex dynamic effects **(Transition, Transform)** and visual elements using pseudo-elements **(::before, ::after)** for a pure CSS solution.

## Technologies: 
HTML, CSS (::before, ::after, linear-gradient, transition, transform, clip-path)

## Features:

* Creating decorative elements and shadows using **Pseudo-elements** (`::before`, `::after`) combined with `position`.

* Utilizing **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to reduce code duplication.

* Implementing smooth state changes using **Transition**.

* Executing 2D transformations (`transform`) for effects like rotation or scaling.

* Using **`linear-gradient`** for complex background fills.

* Exploring additional effects, including **`clip-path`** (for non-rectangular shapes) and **animations** (`animation`).
